  <structural_elements>
    <stanza number="1">
      <theme>Dilemma and Choice</theme>
      <interpretation>The speaker confronts a fork in the road, a metaphor for a significant life decision. The inability to travel both paths highlights the nature of choice.</interpretation>
    </stanza>
    <stanza number="2">
      <theme>Justification of Choice</theme>
      <interpretation>The speaker attempts to rationally justify the choice, even though both paths appear similar ("just as fair"). This points to the subjective nature of decision-making.</interpretation>
    </stanza>
    <stanza number="4">
      <theme>Retrospective Narration</theme>
      <interpretation>The final stanza leaps into the future, showing how the speaker will frame this choice with a "sigh" - which could be of relief or regret. The claim that the choice "made all the difference" is a powerful statement about how we create meaning from our past.</interpretation>
